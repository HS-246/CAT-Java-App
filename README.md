This is an application made for the Caterpiller Code-a-thon with a team of 2.

It is a desktop application that is made with java and java swing libraries which is used as a way to easily digitize service technicians' checklist. 
There is supposed to be a companion webste with added functionalities such as live tracking and pdf converion.
This app however, is made to be ued on the technician's laptop and used for maintainence in remote areas with little to no connectivity.
We are working on making the app form filling voice enabled to further simplify the filling process.
As of right now, the application returns a JSON string on pressing the submit button which can be made to write to a JSON file and then uploaded to the website when connectivity resumes.
